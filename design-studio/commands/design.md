# Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## Context

Design request: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Create a beautiful, distinctive frontend that surprises and delights. Follow these principles:

### 1. Design Thinking (Before Coding)

Before writing any code, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a distinctive aesthetic direction:
  - Brutally minimal
  - Maximalist chaos
  - Retro-futuristic
  - Organic/natural
  - Luxury/refined
  - Playful/toy-like
  - Editorial/magazine
  - Brutalist/raw
  - Art deco/geometric
  - Soft/pastel
  - Industrial/utilitarian
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**State your chosen direction before coding.**

### 2. Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting:

**NEVER use**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system fonts

**Consider**:
- Code aesthetic: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Space Grotesk
- Editorial: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro, Fraunces
- Startup: Clash Display, Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk
- Technical: IBM Plex family, Source Sans 3
- Distinctive: Bricolage Grotesque, Obviously, Newsreader

Use **extreme contrasts**: weight 100/200 vs 800/900, size jumps of 3x+

### 3. Color & Theme

- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Draw from IDE themes, cultural aesthetics for inspiration

**AVOID**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds (classic AI slop)

### 4. Motion

- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Focus on high-impact moments: page load with staggered reveals
- Hover states that surprise
- Smooth, purposeful transitions

### 5. Spatial Composition

- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry
- Overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### 6. Backgrounds & Visual Details

Create atmosphere and depth:
- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors
- Grain overlays

## Output

Generate complete, production-ready code:
- HTML/CSS/JS or React/Vue/Svelte as appropriate
- Include all necessary imports (fonts, libraries)
- Self-contained and functional
- Meticulously refined in every detail

**Remember**: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back!
