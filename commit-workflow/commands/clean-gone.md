description: Clean up local git branches that have been deleted from remote
---

## Your Task

Clean up stale local branches that have been deleted from the remote repository (marked as [gone]).

## Commands to Execute

1. **List branches to identify [gone] status**
   ```bash
   git branch -v
   ```
   
   Note: Branches with a '+' prefix have associated worktrees and must have their worktrees removed before deletion.

2. **Identify worktrees that need removal**
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```

3. **Remove worktrees and delete [gone] branches**
   ```bash
   # Process all [gone] branches, removing '+' prefix if present
   git branch -v | grep '\[gone\]' | sed 's/^[+* ]//' | awk '{print $1}' | while read branch; do
     echo "Processing branch: $branch"
     # Find and remove worktree if it exists
     worktree=$(git worktree list | grep "\\[$branch\\]" | awk '{print $1}')
     if [ ! -z "$worktree" ] && [ "$worktree" != "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" ]; then
       echo "  Removing worktree: $worktree"
       git worktree remove --force "$worktree"
     fi
     # Delete the branch
     echo "  Deleting branch: $branch"
     git branch -D "$branch"
   done
   ```

## Expected Behavior

After executing these commands:

- See a list of all local branches with their status
- Identify and remove any worktrees associated with [gone] branches
- Delete all branches marked as [gone]
- Provide feedback on which worktrees and branches were removed

If no branches are marked as [gone], report that no cleanup was needed.

## Tip

Run `git fetch --prune` first to update remote tracking information if branches show [gone] status incorrectly.
